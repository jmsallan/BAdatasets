# BAdatasets

This package contains datasets to illustrate machine learning algorithms in a Business Analytics (BA) course at Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya. The datasets are not stored in other packages with that purpose like *mlbench*. In some cases, I have relabelled variables of the original dataset for ease of use.

Once you have installed the package, you can see what datasets are available at the moment typing in the R console:

data(package = "BAdatasets")
